# Lightweight requirements for Render free tier (CPU-only, memory-optimized)
# Use this for deployments with <512MB memory constraints

# FastAPI and server (minimal)
fastapi>=0.100.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.23.0
pydantic>=2.0.0

# CPU-only PyTorch (much smaller than full PyTorch)
# This installs torch without CUDA support, reducing size significantly

torch>=2.0.0,<2.2.0

# Transformers (required for model loading)
transformers>=4.35.0

# Utilities (minimal)
