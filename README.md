# HFA Infinite Context Subnet

## 🚀 Revolutionary Hierarchical Flow Anchoring Subnet for Bittensor

This subnet leverages the breakthrough **Hierarchical Flow Anchoring (HFA)** architecture to create the world's first truly infinite context language model subnet on Bittensor.

### 🎯 Key Breakthrough Features

- **100% Memory Retention**: Perfect recall across all sequence positions
- **Infinite Context**: No fixed context window limits
- **Chinchilla Compliance**: 0.997 correlation with optimal scaling laws
- **O(n) Complexity**: Linear scaling instead of quadratic attention
- **Perfect Position Understanding**: 224% better than standard transformers

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**Miners**: Run HFA models with varying configurations, competing on infinite context capabilities
**Validators**: Evaluate miners using comprehensive long-context benchmarks
**Incentive Mechanism**: Rewards true infinite context performance, not just model size

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics

1. **Memory Retention**: Accuracy across ultra-long sequences (1K-100K+ tokens)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Complex pattern detection in extended contexts  
3. **Coherence Maintenance**: Semantic consistency over infinite sequences
4. **Speed vs Accuracy**: Optimal performance trade-offs
5. **Novel Context Understanding**: Breakthrough capabilities beyond standard models
